# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transportation data using python. The dataset used in this analysis contains information related to transportation such as different highway mileages, Air Traffic & Transit Ridership, and other relevant attributes.

# Dataset & Libraries Used
The Dataset used in this analysis can be found in the repo or at this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/monthly-transportation-statistics

### The analysis is performed using Python programming language in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The following Python libraries are used:

<strong> Pandas: </strong> For data manipulation and analysis.
<p></p>
<strong> Numpy: </strong> For data manipulation and analysis.
<p></p>
<strong> Matplotlib:</strong> For data visualization.


# The exploratory data analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading:  Loading the dataset into the notebook.
<p> </p>
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
<p> </p>
Data Exploration: Exploring the distribution and characteristics of each variable in the dataset.
<p></p>
Visualizations: Creating graphical visualizations to gain insights into the data.
<p></p>

# How to Run the Notebook
To run this notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with Python and the required libraries mentioned above. Follow these steps:

Download the "Monthly_Transportation_Statistics.csv" file and place it in the data folder in a jupyter notebook environment.
Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and see the analysis results.

# Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the transportation data, including patterns, trends, and correlations among variables. It can serve as a foundation for further analysis or modeling tasks related to transportation planning, optimization, or decision-making.
